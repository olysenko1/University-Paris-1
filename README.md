# Projects
This repository contains some of the projects done during the my master studies in University Paris 1.

## Monte Carlo simulations 
Done in Python Spyder environment as a part of a Quantitative Methods in Finance class. The purpose is to deploy MC simulations to study the behaviour of VaR and ES for the portfolio of simulated stocks and conclude whether these are appropriate risk measures. Code is explained with the help of notes. 

## Bitcoin network analysis
Done in Python Jupyter environment and Gephi for graphs visualization as a part of Bitcoin Network and Machine Learning class. The purpose is to discover the Bitcoin network using a sample of transaction data. Every step is explained in the notebook.
